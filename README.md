# SelfCommandPrompt
do you have a java command prompt program? then this program is for you. Simply call one line in your first line of your main method. SelfCommandPrompt#runwithCMD and your done. Note by using the overloaded one without the main class as an argument you will be supporting wrappers like eclipse's jar in jar loader when it compiles the jar for you. 

This program is free of charge and open source. On top of that you are also allowed to embedd this into your application programs but, I ask that you update when bugs are fixed
