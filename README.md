# SelfCommandPrompt
do you have a java command line program? then this program is for you. Simply call one line in your first line of your main method. SelfCommandPrompt#runwithCMD and your done. Note by using the overloaded one without the main class as an argument you will be supporting wrappers like eclipse's jar in jar loader when it compiles the jar for you. 

what it does in short:
opens a native command line terminal based on your os once the user double clicks the jar. In the future it will be supporitng mac osx and linux all kernals that support support sh files

This program is free of charge and open source. On top of that you are also allowed to embedd this into your application programs but, I ask that you update when bugs are fixed
