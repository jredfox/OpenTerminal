# SelfCommandPrompt
do you have a java command line program? then this program is for you. Simply call one line in your first line of your main method. SelfCommandPrompt#runwithCMD and your done. you can now double click the jar to open command prompt terminal. Supported oses: windows, mac, linux. for other oses it opens up JConsole which is WIP and doesn't work yet.

Technical:
opens a native command line terminal based on your os once the user double clicks the jar

This program is free of charge and open source. On top of that you are also allowed to embedd this into your application programs but, I ask that you update when bugs are fixed
