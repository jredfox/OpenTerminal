Finish replacing x button functionality{while pids are alive && handle 2d button click && handle taskmanager}
fix task manager make jvm behave clear all signals by doing sigset SIG_DFL, sigset https://stackoverflow.com/a/49897306/8477015 and signal(SIGINT, SIG_DFL);
don't fire shutdown if Control+C is typed instead of being generated (CONTROL+SHIFT+C) to shutdown
add getChildren() and getAllChildren() which returns all children of the current PID

port code to macOs & linux
posix handle real signals unlike windows
verify everything works in java
