Boot:
Tell host using icp the updated colorterm
Tell terminal to update color format, color modes via packets
Tell terminal to handle in, out, err
Tell terminal to terminate itself
re-test getBoot getBootOneLine, colors, profiling on all linux terminals and macOs

Get it working:
re-direct out err and in using network java IPC
- get shutdown to cleanly work if the host or java app shuts down (PID lib JNI required)
- get wrapped arguments before executing jar for wrapped version

Coloring:
- ERR color format printing from the error stream sets to default color after or ERR color when nonnull
- optional custom ERR colorizing support. This Involves overriding the print streams to have 0m + STD / ERR reset pre-pended

profiling:
- wt profiles

Shutdown:
 SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP, and SIGQUIT, SIGBREAK
- on signal close per pos{win, linux, mac} has proper shutdown hooks and handling. for signals like sigterm and kill it will require a custom shutdown thread

Feature updates:
- terminal properties get overriden from command line
- customizable pause at the end of the program message with color support. NOTE: it's a java pause if the message is custom this is to prevent colorizing out of sync issues as the boot shell doesn't know what java set the current colors to
