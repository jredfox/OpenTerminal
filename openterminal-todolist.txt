ot.color.format
ot.color.mode
ot.name
ot.version
ot.force
ot.pause
ot.terminal
ot.conhost
ot.jvmArgs && ot.dirs...= #includes program args if launched with any. this will boot the program if nessary with the proper changes

ot.s = open terminal session used specifically for that launch used by IPC file pipes
ot.bg=background
ot.background=background
